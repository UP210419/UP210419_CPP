# <div align="center"> **CATÂ´S GAME**

**Conclusiones**

The principal objective of this code was to create a representation of the "Game of the Cat", with the use of Functions made in C++, that can show the drawn game board, as well as, a move made by the user with the PC, and, also , indicating if there was a winner and who was such a winner, if there was not, and in other cases, if there was a tie between the participants.

Regarding said code, it was possible to develop the design of such a game board, such as the one that was shown when the users started executing the program. However, it was not possible to indicate whether or not there is a winner in the game, or if it was a tie, so the goal for the activity was not achieved.
