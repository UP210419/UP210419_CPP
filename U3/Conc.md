The main objective of this code was to create a representation of the "Game of the Cat", with the use of Functions made in C++, which can show the drawn game board, as well as, which can allow to carry out a two-player game. who will be the users, and, also, to determine if there was a winner or not and who turned out to be said winner, and in other cases, if there was a tie between the participants.

Regarding said code, it was possible to develop the design of a game board of this type, like the one that is shown when the users start the execution of the program. In addition to what has been mentioned, it was possible to make the code request and register the names of each of the players, as well as the symbol with which each one will be identified on the board when playing it, and at the end, it indicates who was the winner, after the code has identified it during the game.

However, there were both difficulties and limitations during the performance of the activity, after several days of this, which was to ensure that the game could be played by a user and the PC as the players, but after all, to Despite the fact that at first it was somewhat difficult to achieve the main objective, here we have it.
