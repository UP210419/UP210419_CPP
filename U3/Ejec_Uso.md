# <div align="center"> **CATÂ´S GAME**

## ***Execution***
Below are the code execution instructions:

1. Start **execution** of the code.

2. The code asks for the **player names** and ***saves*** them after being entered.

3. The player **selects the mark** to be displayed on the game board, represented by a **character** such as ***"X"*** or ***"O"***, depending on what you entered.

4. The user (or player) enter a numerical value that indicates the space or square that belongs to him on the game board, which will be occupied with the corresponding mark.

5. The code again asks the user for the square (or play) to place it on the board, but this time it is the other player's turn, and so on, alternating the participants, until all the spaces are filled.

6. When all the boxes have been filled in by the participants, the program determines the ***winner*** of the game, and if there was not, it will declare that there was a tie.

## **Use**

This program includes various functions that they make use of, which are the following:

- ***SetMarker()***, is the number of the square that will be occupied by the mark, to put it on the game board.

- ***winner()***, to determine the winner of the game among the participants.

- ***createBoard()***, the game board that will be drawn by the program, representing the game.

- ***game()***, the game of the move that the users will make.

- ***swap_player_and_marker()**, swaps the player and the player after the game, to indicate and give the user his turn when it's time.
