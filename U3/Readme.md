#### <img height="180" src="Caps/Game_of_cat.png" align="left"> **The game of cat or three in a row is a game played between two players, where each player is assigned a different symbol (usually ❌ and ⭕), and spaces are marked on a board of 3\times 3×3 squares, taking alternate shifts; the game ends when one of the players places three of their symbols in line or there are no more empty spaces on the board.**
